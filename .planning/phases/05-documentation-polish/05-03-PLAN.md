<objective>
Restructure and polish README.md for professional presentation.

Purpose: The README is the project's primary documentation and first impression. A well-structured README with clear examples, troubleshooting guidance, and professional layout signals project maturity and makes adoption easier. This is the final polish for portfolio quality.

Output: Restructured README.md with improved visual hierarchy and comprehensive documentation

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure README.md for professional layout</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Restructure README.md following the recommended GitHub Action README pattern from research.

Target structure (research-recommended order):
1. Badges (CI badge already exists - keep it, add License badge)
2. Title + One-line description
3. Features (bulleted list - already good)
4. Quick Start (copy-paste example - move this higher)
5. Usage Examples (simple and advanced - consolidate existing content)
6. Prerequisites (API key setup - already exists)
7. Action Inputs (table - already exists and is good)
8. Troubleshooting (enhance existing content from CLAUDE.md)
9. Architecture (add link to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with small inline diagram)
10. Security (link to SECURITY.md)
11. Contributing (link to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
12. License (MIT - add if missing)

Key changes to make:

**A. Add License badge after CI badge:**
```markdown
[![CI](existing-badge)]
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
```

**B. Move Quick Start higher:**
The "Simple Usage" section should come right after Features, not buried below multiple examples. Users need a working copy-paste example within 30 seconds.

**C. Consolidate usage examples:**
The current README has:
- "Example Workflow" section
- "Testing Configuration" section
- "Simple Usage" section
- "Advanced Usage" section
- "Common Mistakes" section

Consolidate into:
- Quick Start (minimal working example)
- Configuration Options (advanced features)
- Common Mistakes (keep - very useful)

**D. Enhance Troubleshooting section:**
Add content from CLAUDE.md troubleshooting section:
- Symptoms of incomplete changelog
- Root causes (fetch depth, high volume)
- Solutions with code examples
- Verification steps

Use the Symptoms -> Root Causes -> Solutions structure from research.

**E. Add Architecture section:**
Include a small inline Mermaid diagram (simplified version) and link to docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:
```markdown
## Architecture

This action uses intelligent micro-chunking to ensure high-quality summaries:

\`\`\`mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Commits] --> B{>5?}
    B -->|No| C[Single Call]
    B -->|Yes| D[Chunk by 5]
    D --> E[Process Chunks]
    E --> F[Merge Results]
    C --> G[CHANGELOG.md]
    F --> G
\`\`\`

See [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed diagrams and explanation.
```

**F. Add Security and Contributing sections:**
```markdown
## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for our security policy and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Contributing

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
```

**G. Add License section if missing:**
```markdown
## License

[MIT License](LICENSE)
```

Preserve all existing good content - this is reorganization and enhancement, not rewriting.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify all documentation links are valid</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Verify all internal documentation links in README.md point to existing files.

Check that these files exist:
- SECURITY.md (exists)
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (created in 05-01)
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (created in 05-02)
- LICENSE (should exist)
- .github/workflows/example-simple.yml (referenced in README)
- .github/workflows/example-full.yml (referenced in README)

If any referenced files don't exist, either:
1. Create the missing file (for LICENSE if MIT)
2. Update the link to point to correct location
3. Remove broken links

For the example workflow files, verify they exist or update the links to point to actual examples.
  </action>
  <verify>
All linked files exist:
`ls SECURITY.md CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md docs/ARCHITECTURE.md LICENSE`
No broken internal links: `grep -E '\]\(.+\.md\)' README.md | grep -v http | while read line; do file=$(echo "$line" | sed 's/.*](\([^)]*\)).*/\1/'); [ -f "$file" ] || echo "Missing: $file"; done`
  </verify>
  <done>All internal documentation links in README.md point to existing files</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
All verification commands should pass:

```bash
# Required sections exist
grep -q '## Troubleshooting' README.md
grep -q '## Architecture' README.md
grep -q '## Security' README.md
grep -q '## Contributing' README.md

# Required links exist
grep -q 'docs/ARCHITECTURE.md' README.md
grep -q 'SECURITY.md' README.md
grep -q 'CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md' README.md

# Badges exist
grep -q 'License-MIT' README.md
grep -q 'ci.yml/badge.svg' README.md

# Mermaid diagram in README
grep -q '```mermaid' README.md

# All linked files exist
ls SECURITY.md CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. README has professional layout with clear sections in logical order
2. License badge added alongside existing CI badge
3. Quick Start section appears early (within first 50 lines after badges/intro)
4. Troubleshooting section enhanced with Symptoms -> Causes -> Solutions structure
5. Architecture section with inline Mermaid diagram and link to detailed docs
6. Security section linking to SECURITY.md
7. Contributing section linking to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
8. All internal links point to existing files
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-documentation-polish/05-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
