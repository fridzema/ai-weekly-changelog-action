<objective>
Create community documentation files following open source standards.

Purpose: Professional open source projects require standard community documentation (Code of Conduct for contributor behavior standards, Security policy with real contact info). These files signal project maturity and set expectations for contributors.

Output: Two community documentation files - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (new) and SECURITY.md (updated)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md using Contributor Covenant v2.1</name>
  <files>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</files>
  <action>
Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md in repository root using Contributor Covenant v2.1 template.

Key sections to include:
1. Our Pledge - Standard inclusion statement
2. Our Standards - Examples of positive and unacceptable behavior
3. Enforcement Responsibilities - Community leader duties
4. Scope - When CoC applies (project spaces and representation)
5. Enforcement - Use GitHub Security Advisories URL as contact method
6. Enforcement Guidelines - Correction, Warning, Temporary Ban, Permanent Ban
7. Attribution - Credit to Contributor Covenant with version 2.1 link

For the enforcement contact, use:
```
https://github.com/fridzema/ai-weekly-changelog-action/security/advisories/new
```

This uses GitHub's built-in private reporting mechanism instead of email (research recommendation).

Do NOT include placeholder text like [INSERT CONTACT METHOD] - use the actual GitHub URL.

File exists: `ls CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
No placeholders: `! grep -E '\[INSERT|\[YOUR|your-domain\.com' CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
Contains Contributor Covenant: `grep -q 'Contributor Covenant' CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
Contains v2.1: `grep -q '2.1' CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
  </verify>
  <done>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md exists with Contributor Covenant v2.1 content and GitHub Security Advisories as contact method</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update SECURITY.md to replace placeholder email</name>
  <files>SECURITY.md</files>
  <action>
Update SECURITY.md to replace the placeholder email with GitHub Security Advisories as primary contact.

Current placeholder to replace:
```
2. Email: [security@your-domain.com] (replace with your actual contact)
```

Replace with:
```
2. **Use GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/fridzema/ai-weekly-changelog-action/security/advisories/new)
```

This approach:
- Uses GitHub's built-in private reporting mechanism
- No need to maintain a separate email address
- Integrates with GitHub's security workflow
- Recommended by research findings

Also update the numbered list since GitHub Advisories becomes the preferred method:
1. Do NOT open a public GitHub issue
2. Use GitHub Security Advisories (preferred) - with link
3. Or contact via GitHub Discussions for non-critical security questions

Ensure NO placeholder text remains (no [square brackets] except markdown links, no your-domain.com).
  </action>
  <verify>
No placeholders: `! grep -E '\[security@|your-domain\.com|\(replace with' SECURITY.md`
Contains GitHub Advisories link: `grep -q 'security/advisories/new' SECURITY.md`
Link is correct: `grep -q 'fridzema/ai-weekly-changelog-action/security/advisories' SECURITY.md`
  </verify>
  <done>SECURITY.md has GitHub Security Advisories as primary contact with no placeholder email</done>
</task>

All verification commands should pass:

```bash
# CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md exists and is valid
ls CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
grep -q 'Contributor Covenant' CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
grep -q '2.1' CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

# SECURITY.md has no placeholders
! grep -E '\[security@|your-domain\.com' SECURITY.md

# Both files use GitHub Security Advisories
grep -q 'security/advisories/new' CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
grep -q 'security/advisories/new' SECURITY.md

# No placeholder patterns in either file
! grep -E '\[INSERT|\[YOUR|\(replace with' CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md SECURITY.md
```
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md exists in repository root with Contributor Covenant v2.1 content
2. SECURITY.md contains GitHub Security Advisories URL as primary contact method
3. Neither file contains placeholder text (no [INSERT], [YOUR], your-domain.com, or "(replace with...)")
4. Both files use consistent contact method (GitHub Security Advisories)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-documentation-polish/05-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
