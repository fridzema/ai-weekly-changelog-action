# Milestone v1.0: Quality Engineering

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-06
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 14

## Overview

Transform a functional GitHub Action into a portfolio-quality open source project through systematic quality improvements. Starting with essential code fixes, we'll add comprehensive testing infrastructure, enforce code quality standards with modern tooling, automate checks through CI/CD, and polish documentation to professional standards. Each phase builds on the previous, creating a working example of production-quality engineering that demonstrates both technical skill and attention to polish.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Code Foundation

**Goal**: Fix existing code quality issues to create clean foundation for testing
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: FIX-01, FIX-02, FIX-03, FIX-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Fix bare exception handlers and add language fallback warning
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Add API key redaction to all error message paths

**Success Criteria:**
1. All bare exception handlers use specific exception types with proper logging
2. Language fallback to English logs warning message visible in Action output
3. API key never appears in error messages or logs in any error path
4. Codebase is ready for test suite addition (no silent failures that would hide test issues)

**Completed:** 2026-02-03

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure

**Goal**: Add pytest-based test suite achieving 80%+ coverage on core logic
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-03, TEST-04, TEST-05, TEST-06
**Plans**: 5 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Set up pytest infrastructure with shared fixtures and configuration
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Create tests for retry decorator and API key redaction
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Create tests for chunking algorithm and language configuration
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Create tests for changelog file operations
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — Run full test suite and verify 80%+ coverage

**Success Criteria:**
1. pytest runs successfully with pyproject.toml configuration
2. Retry decorator tests verify all error conditions (429, 401, 404, timeout, network) with mocked responses
3. Chunking algorithm tests cover boundary conditions (0, 1, 5, 6, 100+ commits) and merge logic
4. Changelog file operations tests verify create, update, duplicate detection, and force update behaviors
5. Language configuration tests validate lookup and fallback to English for all 5 supported languages
6. Code coverage report shows 80%+ coverage on src/generate_changelog.py

**Completed:** 2026-02-03
**Result:** 61 tests, 91% coverage (exceeded target)

### Phase 3: Code Quality Tooling

**Goal**: Configure and apply modern Python quality tooling (Ruff, mypy, security scanners)
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: QUAL-01, QUAL-02, QUAL-03, QUAL-04, QUAL-05, QUAL-06, QUAL-07
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Configure Ruff, mypy, and pip-audit in pyproject.toml
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Apply Ruff formatting and fix all linting errors
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Add type hints and verify all quality tools pass

**Success Criteria:**
1. Ruff linting configuration exists in pyproject.toml and ruff check passes with zero errors
2. Ruff formatting applied to entire codebase (consistent style throughout)
3. Ruff S (security) rules enabled and passing (replaces standalone Bandit)
4. pip-audit dependency scanner configured and reports no vulnerable dependencies
5. Type hints added to all public functions and mypy type checking passes
6. All quality tools run successfully without breaking existing test suite

**Completed:** 2026-02-03
**Result:** Zero linting errors, zero type errors, zero vulnerabilities

### Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline

**Goal**: Automate quality checks through GitHub Actions workflow with visible status badges
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: CI-01, CI-02, CI-03, CI-04, CI-05
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Create CI workflow with parallel jobs and add status badge to README

**Success Criteria:**
1. GitHub Actions workflow runs tests automatically on every push and pull request
2. GitHub Actions workflow runs linting checks (Ruff) on every push and pull request
3. GitHub Actions workflow runs security scans (Ruff S rules, pip-audit) on every push and pull request
4. CI status badge appears in README showing current build status
5. All CI checks pass (green badge visible) for main branch

**Completed:** 2026-02-04
**Result:** 4 parallel CI jobs (lint, test, type-check, security)

---

### Phase 5: Documentation Polish

**Goal**: Professional documentation and presentation for portfolio quality
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: DOC-01, DOC-02, DOC-03, DOC-04, DOC-05, DOC-06, DOC-07
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Create community documentation (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, fix SECURITY.md)
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Create architecture documentation with Mermaid diagrams
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Restructure README for professional presentation

**Success Criteria:**
1. README has professional layout with clear sections and visual hierarchy
2. Installation and usage examples are clear and copy-paste ready
3. All configuration options documented with examples and default values
4. Troubleshooting section updated with common issues and solutions
5. SECURITY.md contains real contact information (no placeholder email)
6. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md added using Contributor Covenant standard
7. Architecture diagram created showing chunking strategy and data flow

**Completed:** 2026-02-06
**Result:** CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md updated, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with 7 diagrams, README restructured (466 lines)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use pytest for testing (Python standard, good fixture support) → ✓ Good - 61 tests, 91% coverage
- Use ruff for linting (Fast, modern, replaces multiple tools) → ✓ Good - replaced black, isort, flake8
- Use mypy for type checking (Industry standard) → ✓ Good - found Optional handling issues
- Use pip-audit for security (Official Python security scanner) → ✓ Good - zero vulnerabilities
- Skip contribution workflow (User prioritized tests/docs) → ✓ Good - CODE_OF_CONDUCT covers basics
- Use GitHub Security Advisories for contact (Modern private reporting) → ✓ Good - no email maintenance
- 7 focused Mermaid diagrams vs 1-2 large (Easier to understand) → ✓ Good - better comprehension
- OSError for file operations (Covers all I/O errors) → ✓ Good - cleaner error handling
- Dual API key redaction strategy (Exact match + regex) → ✓ Good - caught edge cases in tests
- Extract nested functions for testability → ✓ Good - enabled proper unit testing
- 80% coverage threshold (Standard Python quality bar) → ✓ Good - exceeded at 91%

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed bare exception handlers that silently failed
- Added API key redaction across all error paths
- Replaced silent language fallback with warning messages
- Updated SECURITY.md placeholder with GitHub Security Advisories
- Achieved comprehensive test coverage (91% vs 80% target)
- Configured modern quality tooling (Ruff, mypy, pip-audit) with zero errors
- Automated quality checks with GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Created professional documentation structure

**Issues Deferred:**
