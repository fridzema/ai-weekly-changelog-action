## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| CONTRIBUTING.md + PR templates | User didn't prioritize contribution workflow |
| Mobile app or web UI | This is a CLI/CI tool |
| Support for other AI providers | OpenRouter already supports multiple models |
| Real-time notifications | Batch changelog generation is the use case |
| Changelog archival/rotation | Defer to future if file size becomes issue |
